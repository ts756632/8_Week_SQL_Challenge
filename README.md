# Case Study #6: Online Store Clique Bait

I am interested in customer behavior in an online shopping website. Through data analysis we can understand customers buying habits, including product preference, frequency patterns, and background factors influencing their decision to buy something. <br>

The case study and datasets are from [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-6/) created by Danny Ma. Thank you for the great case study!

## Introduction

Clique Bait is not like regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - we are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which we will need to combine to solve all of the questions. Take a look at the data [here](https://github.com/ts756632/8_Week_SQL_Challenge/blob/main/Dataset.md)!
