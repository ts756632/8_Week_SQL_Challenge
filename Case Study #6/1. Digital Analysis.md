**1. How many users are there?**

 **Thinking Process**

 -  Find out unique user_id. 

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
  FROM clique_bait.users;
````
 **Why I use these functions?**

 -  We use the DISTINCT function to obtain unique user_id. 
 -  Use the COUNT function to calculate the total number of users from the "users" table.

 -  There are 500 unique users.

***

**2. How many cookies does each user have on average?** 
 
 **Thinking Process**

 -  Group data by user_id
 -  Count the number of cookies each user has. 
 -  Calculate the average number for all users.
 
````sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(count_cookies),3) AS average_cookies
FROM
(SELECT user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) AS count_cookies
  FROM clique_bait.users 
  GROUP BY user_id
  )sub;
````
 **Why I use these functions?**

 -  Use the COUNT and GROUP BY functions to find out how many cookies each user has (inner query). 
 -  Use the AVG function to calculate average cookies each user has (outer query).
 -  Use the ROUND function to round the number to 3 decimal places.
 
**Answer:**

 - Each user has 3.564 cookies on average.

***

**3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?**

 **Thinking Process**

 -  Group data by month. 
 -  Calculate the unique number of visits for each month.
 
````sql
  SELECT To_CHAR(event_time,'YYYY-MM') AS month, 
  	 COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits
    FROM clique_bait.events 
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY month;
````
 **Why I use these functions?**

 -  Use the "events" table because we want to know the number of visits. 
 -  Use the To_CHAR function to transform date type into 'YYYY-MM' so we can group data by month. 
 -  Use the COUNT and GROUP BY functions to calculate the unique number of visits by all users per month.
 -  Use the ORDER BY function to have a clear look with the order of month.

**4. What is the number of events for each event type?**

 **Thinking Process**

 -  Group data by event type.
 -  Count the numbers of events for each type. 
 
````sql
SELECT a.event_type, 
       b.event_name, 
       COUNT(a.event_type) AS count_event
  FROM clique_bait.events a 
  JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier b
    ON a.event_type = b.event_type
  GROUP BY a.event_type, b.event_name
  ORDER BY a.event_type;
````
 **Why I use these functions?**

 -  Use the COUNT and GROUP BY function to calculate the number of events for each event type from "events" table. 
 -  Use the JOIN function to combine "events" and "event_identifier" tables so we can get the event_name for each event_type.  
 -  ORDER BY event_type to have a clear view.

**5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?**

 **Thinking Process**
  
 - Count the total number of purchase events. 
 - Count the unique number of visits.
 - Calculate the percentage of visits which have a purchase event.
 
````sql
WITH CTE_new AS(
	SELECT visit_id, 
	       MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase
	  FROM clique_bait.events 
	 GROUP BY visit_id
	 )
 
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS unique_number_of_visits,
        SUM(purchase) AS number_of_purchase, 
        ROUND(CAST(CAST(SUM(purchase)AS float) / CAST(COUNT(*)AS float) *100 AS numeric) , 2) AS percentage
   FROM CTE_new;

````
 **Why I use these functions?**
  
 -  Use the CASE WHEN statement to determine whether a visit has a purchase or not. 
    If a single visit has a purchase event (event_type = 3), then mark "1," otherwise, "0." 
 -  Use the MAX function and GROUP BY visit_id to mark the visits which have a purchase event. 
    Each visit should have at most a purchase event.
 -  Create a CTE using WITH function to store a temporary result. 
 -  Calculate the percentage of visits which have a purchase event by SUM(purchase)/COUNT(*). 
 -  Use the CAST function to transform SUM(purchase) and COUNT(*) into float type to avoid division returning zero. 
 -  Use the CAST function to transform the percentage into numeric type so the ROUND function works.

 - 49.86% of visits which have a purchase event.
***

**6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?**

 **Thinking Process**
  
 - Count the total number of purchase events. 
 - Count the total number of checkout page views.
 - Calculate the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but `do not` have a purchase event.
 
````sql
WITH CTE_new AS(
	SELECT visit_id, 
	       MAX(CASE WHEN page_id = 12 AND event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout,
	       MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase  
	  FROM clique_bait.events 
	 GROUP BY visit_id
	 )
 
 SELECT SUM(checkout) AS number_of_checkout,
        SUM(purchase) AS number_of_purchase,
        ROUND(CAST( (1-CAST(SUM(purchase)AS float) / CAST(SUM(checkout) AS float)) *100 AS numeric) , 2) AS percentage
   FROM CTE_new;
````
**Why I use these functions?**

 -  Customers who have a puchase event must have viewed the checkout page.  
 -  Use the MAX function and CASE WHEN statement to determine whether a visit views the checkout page. 
    If a single visit views the checkout page (page_id = 12 AND event_type = 1), then mark "1," otherwise, "0."  
 -  Use the MAX function and CASE WHEN statement to determine whether a visit has a purchase or not. 
    If a single visit has a purchase event (event_type = 3), then mark "1," otherwise, "0." 
 -  Calculate the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event by 1- SUM(purchase)/SUM(checkout). 
 -  Use the CAST function to transform SUM(purchase) and COUNT(*) into float type to avoid division returning zero. 
 -  Use the CAST function to transform the percentage into numeric type so the ROUND function works.

 - 15.5 % of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event.
***

**7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**
 
 **Thinking Process**
 
 - Filter data with page view events. 
 - Count the number of views for each page. 

````sql
SELECT a.page_id, 
       b.page_name, 
       COUNT(a.page_id) AS number_of_views
  FROM clique_bait.events a 
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b
    ON a.page_id = b.page_id
   AND a.event_type = 1 -- a visit with a page view event
 GROUP BY a.page_id, b.page_name
 ORDER BY number_of_views DESC
 LIMIT 3
````
**Why I use these functions?**

 -  Use the JOIN function to combine "events" and "page_hierarchy" tables so we can get the page_name for each page_id. 
 -  With the conditional statement AND, we can filter data before the join occurs. <br> 
    We are interested in the data with page view event (vent_type = 1) only.  
 -  Use the COUNT and GROUP BY functions to calculate the number of page view events for each page. 
 -  ORDER BY number_of_views DESC and LIMIT 3 to get the top 3 pages by number of views.
 
**Answer:**

 - All Products, Checkout and Home Page.
***

**8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?**

 **Thinking Process**
 
 - Map page_id to product_category by combining "events" and "page_hierarchy" tables.
 - Filter data with Page View and Add to Cart events.
 - Count the number of views and cart adds for each product_category.
 
````sql
SELECT b.product_category,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b   
    ON a.page_id = b.page_id 
   AND b.product_category IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY b.product_category;
````
**Why I use these functions?**


 -  Use the JOIN function to combine "events" and "page_hierarchy" tables and map page_id to product_category. 
 -  With the conditional statement AND, we can filter data before the join occurs. <br> 
    We are interested in the data which product_category IS NOT NULL only.  
 -  Use the GROUP BY, SUM functions and CASE WHEN statement to calculate the number of views and cart adds for each product category.

***

**9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?**

 **Thinking Process**

 -  Filter visit_id to find out customers who have purchase events.
 -  Based on the visit_id which has purchase event, list all products that are added to cart.
 -  Calculate numbers of purchase for each product.
 
````sql
WITH CTE_new AS (
  SELECT a.visit_id, 
  	 a.page_id
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN 
    (SELECT visit_id
       FROM clique_bait.events
      WHERE event_type = 3) sub  -- filter visit_id to find out customers who have purchase events
   ON a.visit_id = sub.visit_id 
  WHERE event_type = 2  -- list all products that are added to cart
  ORDER BY visit_id, page_id
  )
  
 SELECT c.product_id, 
 	c.page_name AS product_name,  
        COUNT(c.product_id) AS number_of_purchase
   FROM CTE_new b
   JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy c
     ON b.page_id = c.page_id
  GROUP BY c.product_id, c.page_name 
  ORDER BY number_of_purchase DESC
  LIMIT 3
````
 **Why I use these functions?**
 
 -  Find out visit_id with Purchase event (event_type = 3) using WHERE clause to filter data (inner query in CTE).
 -  SELF JOIN "events" table to get the data with Add to Cart event (WHERE event_type = 2) to find out what products do people purchase for each visit. 
 -  Create a CTE to store the temporary data.
 -  Combine "CTE_new" and "page_hierarchy" tables to find out product_name (i.e.page_name).
 -  COUNT purchases for each product.
 -  Use LIMIT function to list top 3 products by purchase.
