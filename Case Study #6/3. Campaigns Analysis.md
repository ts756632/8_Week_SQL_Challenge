## Campaigns Analysis (ongoing)

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

- user_id
- visit_id
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:

- Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
- Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
- What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
- What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to each other?

1. Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event.

````sql
WITH metrics AS (

SELECT b.user_id, a.visit_id, MIN(a.event_time)AS visit_start_time, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
       MAX(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
       c.campaign_name,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
       STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN d.page_name END, ',' ORDER BY a.sequence_number ASC)  AS cart_products
FROM clique_bait.events a
JOIN clique_bait.users b ON a.cookie_id = b.cookie_id
JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier c 
ON a.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy d ON a.page_id = d.page_id 
GROUP BY b.user_id, a.visit_id, c.campaign_name
  
)

SELECT campaign_name, impression, COUNT( DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_users, COUNT(visit_id) AS count_visits, 
       ROUND(AVG(page_views),2) AS avg_page_views, ROUND(AVG(cart_adds),2) AS avg_cart_adds, 
       ROUND(AVG(purchase),2) AS avg_purchase, ROUND(AVG(click),2) AS avg_click
FROM metrics
GROUP BY campaign_name, impression

From the table, we can see that for each campaign, there are more unique users and visits who have received impressions during each campaign period than who don't. On the other hand, the metrics including page_views, cart_adds and purchase show that visits with impressions are higher than visits without an impression event. 

Let's take a closer look at the cart_adds column in "BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments" campaign, we can see that the average number of cart add events for visits with impressions are 3.8 times than visits without impressions. Also, we know that the average number of ad clicks event for each visit is about 0.8. (range from 0.78 to 0.85) This is telling us that around 80% of the visitors would click the ad when they receive impressions. From the data, we know the impression event make a good effect.

2. Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?

````sql
WITH metrics AS (

SELECT b.user_id, a.visit_id, MIN(a.event_time)AS visit_start_time, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
       MAX(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
       c.campaign_name,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
       STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN d.page_name END, ',' ORDER BY a.sequence_number ASC)  AS cart_products
FROM clique_bait.events a
JOIN clique_bait.users b ON a.cookie_id = b.cookie_id
JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier c 
ON a.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy d ON a.page_id = d.page_id 
GROUP BY b.user_id, a.visit_id, c.campaign_name
  
)

SELECT click,
       ROUND(AVG(purchase),2) AS avg_purchase
FROM metrics
GROUP BY click

Yes, clicking on an impression leads to higher purchase rates. The average number of purchase rate for no ad click is 0.4, while clicking on an impression leads to 0.9 purchase rate.
