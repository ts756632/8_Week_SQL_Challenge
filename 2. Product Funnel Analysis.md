## Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?

````sql
WITH PageView_CartAdd AS (
SELECT b.product_id, 
       b.page_name AS product_name,	
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views, -- numbers of page views
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds -- numbers of cart adds
       FROM clique_bait.events a
       JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id
       AND b.product_id IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY b.product_id, b.page_name
 ORDER BY b.product_id
 ),
  
  
abandoned_evnets AS (
SELECT b.product_id, 
       b.page_name AS product_name,
       COUNT(a.page_id) AS abandoned -- numbers of abandonded
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id 
  WHERE visit_id NOT IN  
	    (SELECT visit_id
	       FROM clique_bait.events
	      WHERE event_type = 3)   -- filter visit_id to find out customers who don't have purchase events
  AND a.event_type = 2
  AND b.product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY b.product_id, b.page_name
ORDER BY b.product_id
 ),
    
purchase_events AS (
SELECT b.product_id, 
       b.page_name AS product_name,
       COUNT(a.page_id) AS purchases -- numbers of purchases
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id 
  WHERE visit_id IN  
	    (SELECT visit_id
	       FROM clique_bait.events
	      WHERE event_type = 3)   -- filter visit_id to find out customers who have purchase events
  AND a.event_type = 2
  AND b.product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY b.product_id, b.page_name
ORDER BY b.product_id
 ),
    
 -- combine the 3 derived tables above

 combined_product AS (
 
 SELECT  e.*, f.abandoned, g.purchases
 FROM PageView_CartAdd e
 JOIN abandoned_evnets f ON e.product_id = f.product_id
 JOIN purchase_events g ON e.product_id = g.product_id
  )

SELECT *    
FROM combined_product

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each `product category` instead of individual products.


````sql
WITH PageView_CartAdd AS (
SELECT b.product_category,	   
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views, -- numbers of page views
       SUM(CASE WHEN a.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds -- numbers of cart adds
       FROM clique_bait.events a
       JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id
       AND b.product_id IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY b.product_category
 ),
  
  
abandoned_evnets AS (
SELECT b.product_category, 	   
       COUNT(a.page_id) AS abandoned
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id 
  WHERE visit_id NOT IN  
    (SELECT visit_id
       FROM clique_bait.events
      WHERE event_type = 3)   -- filter visit_id to exclude customers who have purchase events
  AND a.event_type = 2
  AND b.product_category IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY b.product_category     
 ),
    
purchase_events AS (
SELECT b.product_category, 	   
       COUNT(a.page_id) AS purchases
  FROM clique_bait.events a
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy b ON a.page_id = b.page_id 
  WHERE visit_id IN  
    (SELECT visit_id
       FROM clique_bait.events
      WHERE event_type = 3)   -- filter visit_id to find out customers who have purchase events
  AND a.event_type = 2
  AND b.product_category IS NOT NULL
     GROUP BY b.product_category    
 ),
 
 combined_category AS (   
  
 SELECT  e.*, f.abandoned, g.purchases
 FROM PageView_CartAdd e
 JOIN abandoned_evnets f ON e.product_category = f.product_category
 JOIN purchase_events g ON e.product_category = g.product_category
   )

SELECT *    
FROM combined_category

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

````sql
 SELECT product_name,
 	page_views 
 FROM combined_product 
 WHERE page_views = (SELECT MAX(page_views) 
 		       FROM combined_product)
````

- Oyster has the most views.



````sql

 SELECT product_name,
 	cart_adds 
 FROM combined_product 
 WHERE cart_adds = (SELECT MAX(cart_adds)
